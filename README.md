# SeniorSeminarProject21

This is a repository for the senior project during Spring 2021.

In order to run the web app with its full functionality,
first change the useState('GoodBye') in index.js to useState('Home'),
then run the command 'npm run dev' in the terminal of VS Studio Code, or any other terminal,
and access http://localhost:3000/ in your preferred browser once the project compiles successfully.

If you load the project locally without changing useState, you will see the closed website.

Intro video and Crush List will not be available after June 19th.
