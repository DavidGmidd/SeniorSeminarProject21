# SeniorSeminarProject21

This is a repository for the senior project during Spring 2021.

In order to run the web app, run the command 'npm run dev' in the terminal of VS Studio Code,
and access http://localhost:3000/ in your preferred browser once the project compiles successfully.

Unfortunately, the intro video and form for Crushes are no longer available 
because the Vimeo account used for them is now closed.
There is an image of the intro video and crushes form on our poster.
